      <p>A&M Craft Beers<br><br>
      About Us:<br>
      Founded: 2015<br>
      Ownership: Private<br>
      Headquarters: Riihimäki, Finland<br><br>
      A&M Craft Beers Co. is a startup company specialized in importing and brewing of craft beers.<br>
      A&M imports highly sought after craft beers from around the world, catering to the most acquired tastes without forgetting variety.<br>
      Our company was founded because we got sick of the lack of variety in the Finnish craft beer selection, 
      so we decided to change that.<br><br>
      We started out just brewing our most well known beer, Pohjankorpi IPA and only 3 months later we introduced TWO 
      new beers into our roster, JytäAPA and Juppala Imperial Stout which were instant hits among all beer enthusiasts.
      A year later, in spring 2016 we announced that we were going to partner with Bell's Beer and start importing their 
      most sought after beers.
      January last year, 2017, we partnered with two other breweries, Beavertown Brewery and Nøgne Ø. 
      We also expanded our selection from Bell's Beers to include almost their whole selection.<br><br>
      This turned out to be a major success for us, since we were the first to deliver to a growing demand
      for specialty craft beers. For example, one of our major hits was Nøgne Ø's Havrestout,
      a sweet stout brewed with malted wheat, oat and barley.<br><br>
      Later that year, we moved shop to a larger facility matching our growing need for operating space. 
      The construction of our warehouse began in January 2018 and is set to be completed in October.
